     <h1 style="color: black;">Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy</h1>
     <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Yeduguri Sandinti Jagan Mohan Reddy, widely known as Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, is an Indian politician and entrepreneur born on December 21, 1972, in Pulivendula, Andhra Pradesh. He is the son of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy.
         Jagan began his career in business before entering politics, initially campaigning for the Indian National Congress in 2004. In 2009, he was elected as the Member of Parliament from Kadapa. After the sudden death of his father in a helicopter crash in 2009, Jagan founded the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) in 2011, 
         embarking on a massive padayatra to connect with the people across Andhra Pradesh. His political journey was marked by both rapid ascent and legal challenges, including a high-profile arrest in 2012 on embezzlement charges. Despite setbacks, Jagan led the YSRCP to a historic victory in the 2019 
         Andhra Pradesh Assembly elections, winning 151 out of 175 seats and becoming the state’s Chief Minister. His tenure was characterized by a focus on welfare schemes like Jagananna Amma Vodi and Navaratnalu, as well as the controversial proposal to establish three capitals for the state. However, in the 2024 elections, 
         his party suffered a significant defeat, dropping to just 11 seats, after which he resigned as Chief Minister. Jagan remains a prominent figure in Andhra Pradesh politics and continues to serve as the MLA for Pulivendula.

        directing a large portion of the company’s profits toward charitable trusts focused on education, healthcare, and rural development. His leadership style emphasized innovation, consolidation, and grooming young talent, and he implemented key reforms such as setting retirement ages to rejuvenate the group’s management.
         For his contributions, he was honored with India’s Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008. Even after retirement, he remained influential as the head of Tata Trusts and continued to invest in startups and serve on various global corporate boards. Ratan Tata’s legacy is that of a transformative leader who 
         globalized Indian industry while maintaining a strong commitment to philanthropy and social responsibility.

     <h1 style="color: mediumblue;">Dr. P. Satish Kumar</h1>
     <p style="font-size: 22px; color: white;">Dr. Satish Kumar is the founder and senior pastor of Calvary Temple, a prominent megachurch located in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. Born in 1971 into a poor family, Satish Kumar faced a troubled childhood and adolescence, struggling with negative influences 
        before experiencing a profound personal transformation after a spiritual encounter with Jesus Christ. Inspired by this change, he dedicated his life to Christian service, starting with youth fellowship activities and eventually founding Calvary Temple in 2005 with just 25 members. Under his visionary
         leadership, the church experienced rapid growth, reaching nearly 200,000 members by 2018 and becoming known for its massive sanctuary, which was famously constructed in just 52 days a feat often compared to the biblical story of Nehemiah.

        Calvary Temple is recognized for its large-scale humanitarian efforts, such as distributing 800 tons of food to the poor during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, reaching tens of thousands of families across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Dr. Satish Kumar is respected not only for his dynamic preaching and leadership 
        but also for his commitment to service, inclusivity, and promoting values of love, hope, and redemption. He has received several honors, including the Doctor of Divinity award from Dallas Baptist University and the Mother Teresa Award for his humanitarian work. Calvary Temple operates as a non-denominational, evangelical 
        church and is considered a trailblazer in the Indian Christian community, blending global megachurch trends with local cultural values.
